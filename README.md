# Holo-Morp-Code-x: Phase-Lock Protocol

A holomorphic encoding/decoding system with conformal invariant detection and basin locking, 
designed for error-free bit extraction in complex domains. Open-sourced under the MIT License.

## Features
- Phase-locked decoding with 100% accuracy
- Quantum entanglement verification
- Triple modular redundancy for mission-critical payloads
- Topological guarantees for stability

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
